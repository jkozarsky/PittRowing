							<div class="bold" id="class">(Head Coach)</div>
							<div class="details">Fourteen years ago Daniel Grancea assumed the responsibility and role as the Head Coach of the University of Pittsburgh Rowing Club. Coming into a team built on potential, he had a vision for the future that perhaps few could perceive. Over the years Daniel has invested unimaginable amounts of his time and energy into building a lasting legacy for the University of Pittsburgh Rowing Club.<br/><br/>In these fourteen short years this vision has become a reality. Under Daniel's leadership, the team has come to achieve numerous institutional and athletic successes, acquiring a brand new fleet of racing shells, the development of a strong network of administrative and financial relations, and of course, medals earned on the water. Recognized in 2011 as ACRA Regional Coach of the Year, Daniel encourages the qualities of perseverance, self-discipline, pride, and passion in all his rowers as athletes and individuals in our everyday lives. Throughout every year, every practice, and every stroke, Daniel's unyielding confidence and standards that he has taught us to uphold in ourselves has made Pitt Crew the successful team that it has come to be.</div>
